# Web-Scraping

**Problem statement:**

Develop a web scraping tool to extract data from the website of a large online retailer to track the prices of products over time. The tool should be able to extract the following information for each product:

* Product name
* Product description
* Product price
* Product rating
* Number of reviews

The tool should be able to scrape data from all pages of the website, including product pages, category pages, and search results pages. The scraped data should be stored in a database for further analysis.

**Data set:**

The data set will consist of the following information for each product:

* Product name
* Product description
* Product price
* Product rating
* Number of reviews
* Date and time scraped

The data set can be used to track the prices of products over time, identify trends, and compare prices across different retailers.

## Additional considerations:

* The website may have different layouts for different product categories. The web scraping tool should be able to handle this variability.
* The website may have rate-limiting mechanisms in place to prevent excessive scraping. The web scraping tool should be designed to respect these rate limits.
* The website may change its layout or structure over time. The web scraping tool should be able to adapt to these changes.

## Ethical considerations:

* It is important to respect the terms of service of the website being scraped. Some websites may prohibit scraping altogether.
* It is also important to be mindful of the privacy of users. If the website contains personal data, such as user reviews, it is important to anonymize this data before storing it in the database.

## Applications:

The data set collected from the web scraping tool can be used for a variety of purposes, including:

* Price tracking: Track the prices of products over time to identify trends and find the best deals.
* Product comparison: Compare the prices of products across different retailers to find the lowest price.
* Customer sentiment analysis: Analyze user reviews to identify trends in customer sentiment.
* Market research: Track the popularity of different products and categories to identify market trends.

## Example use case:

A company that sells products online could use the web scraping tool to track the prices of its products on competing websites. This information could be used to ensure that the company's prices are competitive.
